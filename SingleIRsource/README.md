## How to use "requirements.txt"?
1. Go into the project and run:
```
python -m venv daqenv
```
or
```
virtualenv daqenv
```
2. Now you can "activate" the environment by running the activation script.
If you are on Windows use
```
daqenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
otherwise on Linux and macOS use
```
source daqenv/bin/activate
```
3. Now you can install all the packages needed with the following line:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. To exit the virtual environment use the deactivate command.
