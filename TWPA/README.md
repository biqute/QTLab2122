# QTLab2122 - Characterization of a Parametric Amplifier
Laboratory of Solid State and Quantum Technologies  
Laboratory classe for the Master's degree in Physic at the University of Milano-Bicocca.
Official e-learning page [here](https://elearning.unimib.it/course/view.php?id=39139).

The characterization aims to identify the best paramters for the amplification circuit: the pump power and frequency and the bias current.
